# Graph
An implementation of Graph using C++ for computational analysis of things like computational complexity theory or neural networks. 


###Rationale: 
Main motivation for this project was to create an infrastructure for experimental purposes. 
There exists a huge number of libraries which contains a far better implementation of the Graph, however, those fail to explain their architecture and justify the reason behind their architectural decisions. 

#Pre-existing researched libraries:
1. Boost (C++): https://www.boost.org/
2. NetworkX (Python): https://networkx.org/

#What has been done so far:
An initial architecture has been formed which uses builder design pattern to allow a versatile system for the following
1. Using distinct types of Graph representations i.e., Adjacency Matrix
2. Using distinct types of Graphs i.e., Directed Graphs
3. Using distinct types of algorithms on those graphs i.e., Djkestra. 

#Under Progress:
Implementation of classes.
